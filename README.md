# AlifePlus: Emergent A-Life for STALKER Anomaly

You are not special.

AlifePlus is a reactive alife framework for STALKER Anomaly - a complete simulation layer that replaces passive A-Life with event-driven emergent behavior. It intercepts engine events, classifies them into causes through world-state predicates, and dispatches consequences that change the simulation. The simulation runs independent of the player: engine callbacks fire causes, causes dispatch consequences, consequences chain into new causes. Without spawning, teleporting, or faking.

Any alife scenario that can be described as "when X happens, do Y" can be implemented by registering a cause and a consequence. See the [integration guide](doc/integration.md) for examples, API reference, and a two-mod collaboration scenario.
